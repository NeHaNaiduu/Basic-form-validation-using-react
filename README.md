# Form Validation using React

This project demonstrates how to implement form validation in React.

## Features

- **React Components**: Utilizes React components to build the form interface, making it modular and easy to manage.
  
- **State Management**: Implements React state to track form field values and manage their updates in real-time as users interact with the form.
  
- **Validation Logic**: Implements validation rules to enforce constraints on form inputs, ensuring data integrity and accuracy.
  
- **Form Submission Handling**: Defines how the form behaves upon submission, ensuring that only valid data is processed further.

## Usage

1. Fill in the form fields with appropriate data.
   
2. Observe real-time validation feedback as you interact with the form.

3. Submit the form once all validation checks pass.
